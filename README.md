# Fastfish

Fast poisson disk sampling in 2D in Elixir

## Origins of the algorithm
I stumbled on this **elegant visualisation by Jason Davies** (https://www.jasondavies.com/poisson-disc/), based on the paper **"Fast Poisson Disk Sampling in Arbitrary Dimensions" by Robert Bridson, University of British Columbia.**

I was looking for an algorithm to place items on a bounded map with an homogenous repartition with a natural feel.

The linked paper on J.Davies's website was really interesting because of its conciseness and clarity. It fits on a single page.

## Implementation - read a paper together

The code in `fastfish.ex` is **heavily commented** to read along the paper. The main difference is that I need to place a specific number of items with this repartition in an universe, so I don't fill the available space but stop when my items are placed.

## Usage

Don't count on a stable API since I published this mainly to show how you can follow along a concise paper and work through it, but :

```elixir
Fastfish.sample(universe_width, universe_height, distance, k_samples, items)
```


```iex
iex(1)> Fastfish.sample(200, 200, 5, 30, 0..10 |> Enum.into([]))
{:ok,
 [
   %Fastfish.Point{x: 133.22702823516536, y: 68.62183195726422, data: 5},

## Roadmap

- [ ] Compare the na√Øve implementation backed by a map to other data structures
- [ ] Rust FFI via Rustler to build coordinates faster
